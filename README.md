# Espressif ESP8266 Non-OS SDK Project Boilerplate

This repository aims to create a boilerplate for projects that use the ESP8266 Non-OS SDK. Feel free to use this for your own projects and contribute to make this boilerplate even better.


## Important Information

This `Makefile` is setup so that everything is well organized, so it'll automatically use the following directories inside your project:

  - `src/`: Where you should put your source code.
  - `build/`: Where the objects generated by the compiler are going to be stored.
  - `dist/`: Where the linker will leave the binary files.

Whenever you start a new project with this boilerplate make sure to also set the following, very self-explanatory, variables accordingly:

  - `NAME`: Project name.
  - `VERSION`: Project version.
  - `SRC`: Source file names.
  - `PORT`: Where your serial converter is located.
  - `BAUDRATE`: The baud rate for the serial monitor. **NOT THE FLASH BAUD RATE**

## License

This is a boilerplate, so you should be free to do whatever you want with it. No strings attached. Because of the nature of the project I believe the most fitting license is the amazing [WTFPL](http://wtfpl.net/):
